"""Per-identity dataset selection + memory binding (fleet decision D16, OPT-IN).

The self-service counterpart to the operator-side D15 registry.  A
registry-key user (from ``RAG_API_KEY_CLIENTS``) selects datasets on the
``/access`` page — public datasets freely, password-protected ones only with
the correct password as proof — and the selection persists per identity so
BOTH surfaces (MCP tools and the REST API) honor it.  Effective access is
``(operator ACL ∪ self-selections) − exclusions`` — 2026-10 revision (fleet-
owner ruling): the user's checked set IS their world, so a deselect records
an EXCLUSION that hides even an operator-granted (or public) dataset;
re-selecting clears it.  Admin identities are never affected.

Storage: one JSON file per identity under ``{DATA_PATH}/access/<identity>.json``
(the shared RWX PVC — the same store the upload history and dataset metadata
live on), written atomically (temp + ``os.replace``) under a cross-process
fcntl lock, read with an mtime cache (per-process) so hot paths don't re-stat
NFS on every request.  Passwords are stored AS THE CALLER PROVIDED THEM — the
store's trust posture is identical to the unlock caches' (plaintext passwords
at rest in an operator-controlled store); it is NOT a new class of secret.

Configuration:

* ``RAG_ACCESS_STORE`` — set to ``"1"``/``"true"``/``"yes"`` to enable
  (default OFF; when OFF the module is inert and every predicate reports
  "nothing extra").  Server-side personalization without touching D15's
  default posture.
* ``RAG_ACCESS_DENY_SELECT`` — comma-separated dataset names that can never
  be self-selected (operator floor/ceiling protection, e.g. ``hr-data``).
  Re-read per call (rotation without restart).
* ``RAG_MEMORY_DEFAULT`` — deployment-wide fallback memory dataset (used when
  the caller has no memory binding; admin/single-user convenience).

Effective access (``dataset_allowed``):
  admins / no-registry / store-off  → operator behaviour, byte-identical
  registry client                   → operator ACL ∪ selections (denylist
                                       still enforced at selection time;
                                       ``*`` in the operator ACL still wins)

Memory resolution (``memory_dataset_for``):
  explicit arg (caller) → request header (client) → the caller's SAVED
  binding (page star) → ``RAG_MEMORY_DEFAULT`` → ``MEMORY_DATASET`` env.
  The saved binding is consulted only when the bound dataset is actually
  accessible to the identity (fail-soft to the next source).

This module is RAG-local, stdlib-only, dependency-free; it never logs key or
password material.
