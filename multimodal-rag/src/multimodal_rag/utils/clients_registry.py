"""Multi-user API-key registry → dataset ACLs (fleet decision D15, opt-in).

Mirrors K8S-MCP's clients-registry pattern (``K8S_MCP_CLIENTS``): instead of
one shared deployment key, an operator may mint per-user keys and bind each
one to a set of datasets.  Capabilities travel with the credential — a key
holder can never widen their own access.

Configuration (both env vars are read PER REQUEST — a config change needs no
restart, matching the fleet's key-rotation convention):

* ``RAG_API_KEY_CLIENTS`` — ``"name:key;name:key"`` — ';'-separated entries,
  ``name:key`` (K8S_MCP_CLIENTS field rules: keys must not contain ``:`` or
  ``;``).  The same registry serves BOTH the MCP server and the REST API.
* ``RAG_DATASET_ACLS`` — ``"name:ds1,ds2;name2:*"`` — ';'-separated entries,
  ``name:dataset[,dataset...]``.  The special dataset ``*`` grants all
  datasets.  An entry with an empty dataset list grants nothing.

Semantics (ratified D15 — explicitly OPT-IN):

* A key in the registry resolves to a per-key identity; dataset access
  (list/read/search/unlock/manage) is enforced against that identity's ACL.
* A registry key that matches NO ACL entry gets NO datasets (fail-closed).
* The plain deployment keys — ``RAG_API_KEY`` plus the MCP key set
  (``MCP_API_KEYS`` / ``RAG_API_KEYS``, the fleet one-address wiring) — keep
  FULL access (admin semantics).
* DEFAULT (no ``RAG_API_KEY_CLIENTS``): today's single-key behaviour,
  byte-identical — nothing in this module enforces anything.

This module is RAG-local (not part of the pcai_utils hardlink mesh): it is
stdlib-only and dependency-free, and it never logs or returns key material.

    key with no ACL entry resolves to an identity with NO datasets

    on a protected path it is 401.

    Delegation precedence (fleet decision D19, 2026-09-24): when *presenters*
    is provided it carries, per candidate key, the header that presented it
    (``"x-api-key"`` or ``"authorization"``).  A key presented via
    ``X-API-Key`` takes precedence over a key presented via
    ``Authorization: Bearer`` WHEN the two disagree: ``Authorization`` is
    transport/platform auth (a proxy or LLM gateway forwards its OWN admin
    token next to the caller's chosen ``X-API-Key``), and an explicit
    ``X-API-Key`` is the caller's DELEGATED service identity.  Resolution
    then follows the X-API-Key candidate alone — an admin-token holder can
    only ever DE-ESCALATE itself by also sending an X-API-Key (it could use
    that client key directly anyway), never escalate a client key to admin,

    a candidate that is JWT-shaped (three base64url segments) may resolve

    that user's minted key (same name, same ACLs, same ``client_id``), or to
    a zero-dataset identity for an unknown-but-valid user.  Routing is
    shape-based, never a registry lookup: an opaque key is never parsed as a
    JWT, and a JWT is never compared against key material.  A JWT can only
    ever yield a ``kind="client"`` identity — never admin.  In delegation
    mode only the X-API-Key candidate takes the JWT path (Authorization is
    transport auth, D19 — its Bearer JWT stays transport-only there).  The
