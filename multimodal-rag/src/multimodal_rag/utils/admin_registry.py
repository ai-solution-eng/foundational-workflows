"""File-backed admin overlay for the D15 clients registry (fleet decision D17).

The operator-side counterpart to the D16 access store: per-user keys are
minted and granted from the ``/access`` page (with an ADMIN key) instead of
hand-editing env vars — which a pod cannot do.  The overlay is a single JSON
file on the shared PVC:

    {DATA_PATH}/access/clients.json
    {
      "clients": {
        "alice": {"key": "…", "datasets": ["reports", "notes"]},
        "bob":   {"key": "…", "datasets": ["*"]}
      }
    }

D21 — OIDC sign-in fields (optional, per client entry):

* ``"oidc": "<alias>"`` — binds this client to the JWT identity whose
  ``RAG_OIDC_IDENTITY_CLAIM`` (or ``sub``) resolves to ``<alias>``: the
  verified token then adopts the CLIENT's name and datasets (both
  credentials, one identity — same client_id).  A JWT whose name matches a
  client's name by convention needs no alias.  Must satisfy the registry
  name rules when present.
* ``"blocked": true`` — the identity (by name or alias) resolves to NOTHING:
  a minted key stops authenticating and a matching JWT 401s downstream.
  Env-registry names cannot be blocked (env has no place to say it).

Resolution (the union is computed by ``clients_registry.resolve_presented``
via :func:`overlay_clients` / :func:`overlay_acls` — both re-read per call):

    effective registry = RAG_API_KEY_CLIENTS env  ∪  overlay file
    effective ACLs     = RAG_DATASET_ACLS env     ∪  overlay file

An overlay entry NEVER widens admin power: only the deployment keys
(``RAG_API_KEY`` + the MCP key set) are admin — overlay clients are registry
clients with an ACL, exactly like env clients.  A name present in BOTH env
and overlay keeps its ENV key (env wins on conflict — the operator's
hand-written config is authoritative; delete the env entry to let the page
own the name).  ACLs are merged per name (env ∪ overlay datasets) rather
than replaced, so neither source silently revokes the other.

Security posture:

* The file holds PLAINTEXT keys — the same trust posture as
  ``RAG_API_KEY_CLIENTS`` (which is env/Secret material anyway) and the D16
  store's saved passwords.  0600, atomic temp+replace under the
  cross-process fcntl lock, mtime-cached reads.
* Key generation uses ``secrets.token_urlsafe`` (128-bit entropy).
* Key material is NEVER returned by any listing endpoint in full — mint
  responses carry it ONCE (the only time the operator can copy it);
  listings show a masked prefix (``0HeC9a…``).
* ``RAG_ACCESS_ADMIN_FILE`` (default: enabled when ``RAG_ACCESS_STORE`` is
  on) gates the whole module; when off it is inert and resolves nothing.

This module is RAG-local, stdlib-only, dependency-free; it never logs key
material.
